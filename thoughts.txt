This login setup seems pretty cumbersome.

So far:


Make a HEAD request including the desired username:

- if request returns 200, username exists

- if returns 404, username does not exist


To obtain site cookies:

- make GET request with profile?_={some number, most numbers of correct length work}

-- example: `requests.get('https://pollev.com/proxy/api/profile?_=1488143557016')`

----- run the above in s = requests.Session()



There are multiple POST requests upon login, and one uses an x-csrf-token.
This token is obtained using a `GET csrf_token?_={some long number probably
userid}`.  Looks like I'll need to figure out a way to obtain that userid
number, then request the csrf-token, and use that in my login payload...?
